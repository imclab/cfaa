      [Octopress](http://octopress.org) makes managing static sites and blogs as easy as can be. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) does the same thing for front-end development and styling.

      **[Octostrap](https://github.com/bobwaycott/octostrap) is the baby everyone wanted them to have.**

      Octopress is known for its impressive flexibility to make any page wanted, at any URL, and there's no complicated CMS or admins or other crap getting in the way.

      Bootstrap excels at providing a clean and consistent framework for building up any UI imaginable.

      **Octostrap steps back and lets both of them shine together.**

    subtitle: Speed.

      Not every nail needs a server-side framework+database hammer.

      Not everyone who wants a website or blog wants to figure out how to setup a database, proxy requests, or build models+views+controllers.

      **Octostrap has you covered.**
