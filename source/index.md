          The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is so broad that law
          enforcement says it criminalizes all sorts of mundane Internet use.

          Potentially even breaking a website's fine print terms of service agreement.
          Don't set up a Myspace page for your cat. Don't fudge your height on a dating
          site. Don't share your Facebook password with anybody. 

          **You could be committing a federal crime.**

    subtitle: It's not too late.

        "Aaron's Law" would fix parts of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
        that mean that we are all federal felons. 

        Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Sen. Ron Wyden just introduced "Aaron's
        Law", which would fix some of the worst parts of the Computer Fraud and Abuse
        Act, including those which make it a potential crime to violate terms of
        service agreements -- that fine print that nobody reads at the bottom of a
        website.
  
        **List yourself as a "citizen cosponsor" of Aaron's Law.**
